    title: "Professional Summary",
    aboutme: `I am a Cybersecurity and DevOps Engineer with a unique professional transition from a medical background into technology, bringing precision, accountability, and calm decision-making from high-stakes healthcare environments into secure system design and infrastructure automation.

My experience spans DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity, where I design, deploy, and automate resilient, scalable, and secure systems using modern DevOps and DevSecOps best practices. I focus on embedding security from the ground up, ensuring compliance, reliability, and operational efficiency across the software lifecycle.

I bring strong hands-on skills in Cybersecurity & Blue Team practices, DevOps / DevSecOps pipelines, Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP), containerization & orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes), Cloud & container security, Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible),CI/CD security & supply-chain protection, scripting & automation (Python, Bash), Linux, networking, and system hardening, vulnerability management & penetration testing, Security information and event management (SIEM), monitoring, logging, and incident response.

As an aspiring AI Engineer, I actively explore how artificial intelligence can strengthen Cybersecurity, from threat detection and anomaly analysis to intelligent automation and decision support. I apply AI concepts to help build systems that are adaptive, efficient, and secure by design.

My background in medicine sharpened my analytical thinking and problem-solving, ability to work under pressure, team collaboration and leadership, attention to detail, risk assessment and mitigation, ethical responsibility and compliance, clear communication under pressure.

These strengths now translate directly into protecting digital systems, data, and infrastructure. I am driven by a strong commitment to security, trust, and resilience, helping organizations defend against evolving threats while enabling innovation.

I am passionate about building secure, automated, and intelligent infrastructure that supports long-term growth, regulatory compliance, and equitable access to trustworthy technology.`,
